# Portfolio2.0
full stack portfolio website


Migrated my personal website to a full-stack iteration. The user ( me ) can log in securely and update the website dynamically. Supports CRUD operations to manage my profile, projects, and experiences. Hosted on Heroku.




( yes, i know i didn't use a virtual env during development and my requirements.txt has unnecessary dependencies, I will get around to it. )
